# SAP BTP - Administrator's Guide Samples

## Description

This repository provides samples based on the recommendations given in the [SAP BTP Administrator's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-admin-guide/btp-admin-guide) specifically the section [Setting Up Your Account Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-admin-guide/setting-up-your-account-model).

These samples show the implementation of the recommendations using Infrastructure as Code, namely [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/). They help you getting started with a sustainable setup of your SAP BTP accounts following our best practices.

## Content Structure

The samples are available in the folder `sample-setups`. We provide each scenario in a separate folder. Each folder contains a `README.md` file describing the details.

You find further details in the [`READEME.md`](./sample-setups/README.md) file of the `sample-setups` folder and in the `README.md` files of the individual sample setups

In addition, we have a folder `modules` containing reusable Terraform modules. These modules are used in the sample setups.
